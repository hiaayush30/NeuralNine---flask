Got it 👍 let’s go step by step.

### 1. What `__name__` does in Python

Every Python file has a built-in variable **`__name__`**.

* If you **run the file directly** → `__name__ == "__main__"`
* If you **import the file as a module** → `__name__ == "<module_name>"`

Example `demo.py`:

```python
print(__name__)
```

* Run directly → `python demo.py` → prints `__main__`
* Import → `import demo` → prints `demo`

---

### 2. Why Flask uses `__name__`

When you write:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

* Flask needs to know **where your app lives** (the "root path").
* This helps it automatically find files like:

  * `templates/` (HTML files)
  * `static/` (CSS, JS, images)

By passing `__name__`, Flask can figure out:

* **"Am I being run directly or imported?"**
* **"Where is this file located on disk?"**

---

### 3. Simple analogy

* Think of `Flask(__name__)` like **giving Flask a map** so it knows where to look for your stuff.
* Without it, Flask wouldn’t know the location of your project files.

✅ So `Flask(__name__)` just means:

> "Create a Flask app, using the current file’s location as the base reference."

Do you want me to also show you **what happens if you pass something else** instead of `__name__`?
